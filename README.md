**A multi-layered reasoning framework for understanding conversational transcripts, developed during an ML Hackathon.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

Pravahh is a data science project focused on developing a sophisticated framework for analyzing and deriving insights from conversational transcripts. The project utilizes a multi-layered approach, incorporating a causal inference engine (Layer 3) and a higher-level reasoning engine (Layer 4) to process raw conversational data, structure it, and extract meaningful patterns and evidence. Born out of an ML Hackathon, Pravahh aims to provide a robust methodology for understanding complex interactions within dialogues.

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks implementing the reasoning engines, alongside various datasets (`.json`, `.csv`) used for training, analysis, and storing processed outputs.

## ✨ Features

-   **Conversational Transcript Processing**: Ingests and structures raw conversational data for analytical tasks.
-   **Causal Inference Engine (Layer 3)**: Implements algorithms to identify causal relationships and scores within conversational contexts.
-   **Higher-Level Reasoning Engine (Layer 4)**: Provides advanced reasoning capabilities, building upon the insights from the causal engine to draw more complex conclusions.
-   **Large-Scale Dataset Handling**: Designed to process and manage substantial conversational transcript datasets.
-   **Contextual Query Analysis**: Supports analysis of multi-transcript context queries to derive specific insights.
-   **Evidence Extraction**: Identifies and extracts key evidence from transcripts based on the reasoning process.
-   **ML Hackathon Artifacts**: Includes documentation (`ML_HACKATHON_PRAVAAH.pdf`) outlining the project's context and findings.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the Pravahh project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed.
-   **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and running the analysis.
-   **pip**: Python's package installer.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aditya-singh-ux/Pravahh.git
    cd Pravahh
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    Pravahh relies on standard Python data science libraries. While `Requirments.txt` is currently empty, it is recommended to install common data science packages.
    ```bash
    # It is recommended to create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install core data science libraries
    pip install pandas numpy jupyterlab
    # If a comprehensive `requirements.txt` becomes available:
    # pip install -r Requirments.txt
    ```
    _**TODO**: Populate `Requirments.txt` with exact dependency versions for reproducibility._

3.  **Environment setup**
    The `New Text Document.env.txt` file is present but empty. If the notebooks require specific environment variables (e.g., API keys, configuration paths), they should be defined in a `.env` file (or directly within the notebooks for simplicity in a local setup).
    ```bash
    # Create an .env file if necessary (e.g., touch .env)
    # Add any required environment variables here:
    # EXAMPLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    _**TODO**: If environment variables are required, update `New Text Document.env.txt` to `.env.example` and populate it with necessary variables and descriptions._

4.  **Run Jupyter Notebooks**
    Start the Jupyter Notebook server from the project root:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Your browser should open to the Jupyter interface.

5.  **Explore the notebooks**
    Navigate to and open the following key notebooks:
    -   `layer3_casual_engine.ipynb`: To understand and run the causal inference processes.
    -   `Layer4_reasoning_engine.ipynb`: To explore and execute the higher-level reasoning logic.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
As noted, `New Text Document.env.txt` is empty. If external services or sensitive information (e.g., API keys) are required, it's best practice to use environment variables.

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `[VAR_NAME]` | _(TODO: Add purpose if variables are introduced)_ | `N/A` | `No` |

### Configuration Files
The primary "configuration" for the analytical processes is embedded within the Jupyter Notebooks themselves. Parameters and settings are typically defined in code cells at the beginning of each notebook.

## 🔧 Development

The development workflow primarily involves iterating on the Jupyter Notebooks:

-   **Modify Code**: Edit Python code directly within the `.ipynb` files.
-   **Run Cells**: Execute cells sequentially or individually to observe results.
-   **Data Exploration**: Use notebooks for interactive data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.

## 🧪 Testing

There are no dedicated test files or a testing framework explicitly defined in this repository. Testing is generally performed interactively within the Jupyter Notebooks by running cells and verifying outputs.
